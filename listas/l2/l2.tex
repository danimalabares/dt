\begin{defn}[\(C^k\) topology]\leavevmode
It's a topology on \(C^\infty (X,Y)\) generated by the subsets
\[M_k(U):=\left\{ f \in C^\infty(X,Y) : j^kf \in U  \right\}\]
For any open subset \(U \subset J^k(X,Y)\).

\textbf{Idea.} Put a topology on an infinite-dimensional space coming from finite-dimensional approximations. Infinite-dimensional is a whole Taylor series, a smooth function, and finite dimensional is a finite polynomial, a jet!

But there's something missing! The point \(x\). Because a jet is not a global linear approximation right? So the real definition is
\[M_k(U)=\{f \in C^\infty (X,Y): j^kf(x) \in U \forall x \in X\}\]
But how is the topology on \(J^k(X,Y)\)? Or better yet, what is \(J^k(X,Y)\)? Points are functions from \(X\) to \(Y\) that map \(x\) to \(y\) and agree up to degree \(k\) on their derivative. But it's better to think of it as a bundle (over \(X, Y\) or \(X \times Y\)):  a function gives for every point of \(X\) a \(k\)-jet based on the point; so a thing that is in the fiber \(J^k(X,Y)_{x,f(x)}\). The topology of this bundle is given by local charts using that the \(k\)-polynomials are a vector space.

So, an open set \(U \subset J^k(X,Y)\) is (a union of) coordinate charts of the kind explained above. So you can just think that there is a natural way of saying how close or far away are jets from each other, because jets are simple.

\begin{thing1}{Problem 1}\label{p:1}\leavevmode
Let  \(\Phi=\{\varphi_i,U_i\}_{i \in I}\) be a locally finite atlas of \(X\), \(\mathcal{K}=\{K_i\}_{i \in I}\) a family of compact sets \(K_i \subset U_i\), \(\Psi=\{\psi_i,V_i\}\) an atlas of \(Y\), \(\varepsilon=\{\varepsilon_i\}_{i \in I}\subset \mathbb{R}^+\) and \(f\in C^\infty(X,Y)\) such that \(f (K_i) \subset V_i\). Let
\begin{align*}
W^k(f;\Phi,\Psi,\mathcal{K},\varepsilon)&=\left\{ g \in C^\infty(X,Y)  :\begin{aligned}
&\qquad  \qquad g(K_i)\subset V_i,\\& \|D^r(\psi_i \circ f \circ \varphi_i^{-1})(x)-D^r(\psi_i \circ g \circ \varphi_i^{-1})(x)\|<\varepsilon_i,\\
&\qquad \forall x \in K_i,\qquad \forall i \in I, \qquad \forall r\text{ s.t. } \; 0 \leq r\leq k
\end{aligned}\right\}
\end{align*}\
Prove that the collection of all sets of this form is a base for the \(C^k\) topology on \(C^\infty(X,Y)\).
\end{thing1}

\begin{proof}[Solution]\leavevmode
Fix \(U\) a \(C^\infty\)-open set and  \(f \in U\). We need to show that there is a set of the form \(W^k(f;\Phi,\Psi,\mathcal{K},\varepsilon)\) contained in \(U\).

Since \(f \in U\), by definition of the \(C^\infty\) topology there must be a set
\[M(V)=\{g \in C^\infty(X,Y): j^kg(x) \in V \;\forall x \in X\} \subset U\]
for some  \(V\) open in \(J^k(X,Y)\). We need to construct a set \(W\) contained in \(M(V)\). Fix for now any atlases  \(\Phi,\Psi\) and set of compact sets \(\mathcal{K}\) and set of numbers \(\varepsilon\). To get the contention \(W:=W^k(f;\Phi,\Psi,\mathcal{K},\varepsilon)\subset M(V)\) we must show that any \(g \in W\) satisfies \(j^kg(X) \subset V\), which ``is the definition of being in \(V\)".

Suppose that \(V= J^k(\tilde{U},\tilde{V})\) for some open sets \(\tilde{U} \subset X\) and \(\tilde{V} \subset Y\). Equivalently, \(V\overset{\operatorname{dif}}{\simeq}\tilde{U} \times \tilde{V} \times \tilde{W}\) for some open set \(\tilde{W}\) in an euclidean space (constructed as a polynomial vector space). The condition \(j^kg(x) \in V \forall  x \in X\) may be restated as: the source of \(g\) is in \(\tilde{U}\) (though this is obvious if we take the jet \(j^kg(x)\) for \(x \in \tilde{U}\)), its target is in \(\tilde{V}\), and its derivatives in \(\tilde{W}\).

\end{proof}

\begin{thing1}{Problem 2}\label{p:2}\leavevmode
A function is said to be \textit{\textbf{closed}} if the image of every closed set is closed. Prove that the set \(\{f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}): f \text{ is closed} \}\) is closed in the \(C^\infty\) topology.
\end{thing1}

\textbf{Unfortunately I have no complete solution :(}

\textbf{Attempt 1.} \hspace{.5em} 
	Let \(f \) be a limit point of \(\mathcal{F}=\{g\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}):g\text{ is closed} \}\). To show that \(f\) is closed pick a closed set \(F \subset X\) and let \(y\) be a limit point of  \(F(X)\). Then there is a sequence \(\{x_n\}_n \subset X\) such that \(|f(x_n)-y| \to 0\). Since \(f\) is a limit point of \(\mathcal{F}\) there exists a closed function \(g\) such that \(|g(x_n)-f(x_n)|\to 0\) (for this we can take a ball of radius \(\delta(x)\), a continuous function extending \(\delta(x_n)=1/n\)). Then \(g(x_n) \to y\), so that there is some \(x_0 \in X\) such that \(g(x_0)=y\). But I'm not sure that \(f(x_0)=y\).

\textbf{Attempt 2.} \hspace{.5em}  Let \(f \) be a limit point of \(\mathcal{F}=\{g\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}):g\text{ is closed} \}\). To show that \(f\) is closed pick a closed set \(F \subset X\) and let \(y\) be a limit point of  \(F(X)\). Then there is a sequence \(\{x_n\}_n \subset X\) such that \(|f(x_n)-y| \to 0\). Since \(f\) is a limit point of \(\mathcal{F}\) there exists a sequence of closed functions \(g_k\) converging uniformly to \(f\) on compact sets. Then \(g_k(x_n) \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} y\) for all \(k\). Since each \(g_k\) is closed there must exist \(x_k\) so that \(g_k(x_k) =y\)…

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
The result follows almost immediately from Exercise 8.5 in \cite{muk} (see Problem 4(a) below). Indeed, if a sequence of closed maps \(g_n\) coincides with \(f\) outside some compact set, \(f\) is closed since continuous image of compact sets is compact (and thus closed).
\end{remark}

\begin{thing1}{Problem 3}\label{prob:3}\leavevmode
Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be manifolds and \(\ell \geq  k\). Prove that there exists a natural fiber bundle \(J^\ell(X,Y) \to J^k(X,Y)\) and compute the dimension of its fiber.
\end{thing1}

\begin{proof}[Solution]\leavevmode
Consider the map
\begin{align*}
	\pi: J^\ell(X,Y) &\longrightarrow J^{k}(X,Y) \\
	j^\ell f(p) &\longmapsto j^k f(p)
\end{align*}
for any smooth function \(f \in C^\infty(X,Y)\) and \(p \in X\).

First notice that \(\pi\) is a submersion. Fix a point \(p \in X\) and a jet \(\sigma:= j^\ell f(p)\). After fixing local coordinates on \(X\) and \(Y\), \(\sigma\) has a coordinate representation 
\[\Big((x_1,\ldots,x_n), (y_1,\ldots,y_m),T_\ell f_1(p),\ldots,T_\ell f_m(p)\Big)\]
where \(T_\ell\) gives the truncated Taylor polynomials at \(p\) of the coordinate functions of \(f\) with respect to the chosen coordinates. Then the coordinates of \(\pi\sigma\) are given simply by composing \(T_\ell\) with \(T_k\), which basically means ``forgetting" the coefficients of the Taylor polynomials for degrees above \(k\). This just says that the differential will be the identity in the coordinates of the points in \(X\) and \(Y\), and also for the first \(k\) coordinates of the Taylor polynomials. The rest of the matrix will have zeroes, but it will be full rank since the dimension of \(J^k(X,Y)\) is smaller than that of  \(J^\ell(X,Y)\).

Now pick a jet \(\tau\) downstairs and let's look at \(\pi^{-1}(\tau)\). It's the manifold given by all the \(\ell\)-jets that coincide with \(\tau\) up to order \(k\). Computing its dimension is analogous of computing the dimension of jet spaces in general: it will be the product of the dimensions of \(X\), \(Y\), and the dimension of a certain polynomial space. For the polynomial coordinates we need to consider how the Taylor expansion of the coordinate functions can vary in degrees between  \(k+1\) and \(\ell\). It is \(m \sum_{r=k+1}^\ell \binom{r+n-1}{n-1}\) according to the following combinatorial argument.

\begin{quotation}
For each coordinate function of \(f\), we consider its Taylor polynomial at \(p\), which is a polynomial in  \(n\) variables. We need to put a number (a coordinate) at every monomial. Every monomial is determined by the exponents we put in each indeterminate. The exponents should add up to the degree of the monomial, say \(r\) where \(k<r\leq \ell\). Thus different monomials are different choices of \(n\) nonnegative integers that add up to \(r\). That's like putting \(r\) balls in \(n\) boxes, which is like putting \(n-1\) ``divisions" among the \(r\) objets. So it's a choice of \(n-1\) things among \(r+n-1\) things. Taking into account the \(m\) polynomials, this gives the above number.
\end{quotation}

To conclude we must show that \(\pi\) admits local trivializations. Let \(\tau \in J^k(X,Y)_{p,q}\). An open neighbourhood \(W\) of \(\tau\) is a product of neighbourhoods of \(p\) and \(q\) in their respective spaces, and \(\mathbb{R}^N\) for some crazy \(N\). The inverse image \(\pi^{-1}(W)\) only differs from \(W\) in the polynomial part, where now we consider polynomials up to degree \(\ell\) instead of only \(k\).

The key observation here is that the fiber \(\pi^{-1}(\tau)\) is given precisely by varying the last \(\ell-k\) coordinates of the polynomial part. This yields a local trivialization \(\pi^{-1}(W) \cong W \times F\).
\iffalse
The 

A diffeomorphism \(\pi^{-1}(W) \cong W \times F\) is given as 
\begin{align*}
	 \pi^{-1}(W) &\longrightarrow W \times F \\
	 (p,q,T_\ell (\sigma)) &\longmapsto (p,q,T_k(\sigma)),
\end{align*}
\fi

\begin{thing1}{Problem 4}\label{p:4}\leavevmode
Let \(M\) be a non-compact manifold.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that multiplication by scalar \(\mathbb{R}\times C^\infty (M,\mathbb{R})\to C^\infty (M,\mathbb{R})\) is not continuous in the \(C^\infty \) topology.
\item Prove that addition and multiplication of functions are continuous in the \(C^\infty \) topology.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thing1}

\begin{proof}[Solution]\leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Fix \(f \in C^\infty (M,\mathbb{R})\). Then we have a multiplication map \(\mu_f:\mathbb{R}\to C^\infty (M,\mathbb{R}\). If \(\mu_f\) was continuous, we'd have that \(\lim_{n}f/n=0\) in the \(C^\infty\) topology (because it's the image of the sequence \(1/n\) under a continuous map). Chose an open ball of the constant function 0 of raduis a function \(\delta(x)\). There would have to exist a number \(N\) such that \(\forall n>N\), \(\frac{1}{n}|f(x)|<\delta(x)\).

	A smart choice of \(f\) and \(\delta\) should be enough to show that it holds. Notice that if \(M\) is compact,  there would be constants \(f(x) \leq M\) and \(M_1 \leq  \delta(x)\), so that for big \(n\), \(f(x)/n \leq  M/ n <  M_1 \leq \delta(x)\) would always hold, meaning \(f/n\) does converge to \(0\).

	Since \(M\) is not compact, there is a function that grows faster than \(n\), so that \(f(x)/n\) would be eventually larger than any number, so that fixing a constant raduis  \(\delta(x)\equiv c>0\) would give a contradiction. A formal way to construct such \(f\) is by introducing a Riemannian metric on \(M\) and using the distance to a fixed point, which would diverge since otherwise we could show \(M\) is sequentially compact. This completes the proof.

\textbf{Incomplete alternative attempt}


	Fix \(f \in C^\infty (M,\mathbb{R})\). Then we have a multiplication map \(\mu_f:\mathbb{R}\to C^\infty (M,\mathbb{R}\). Following \cite{gui2}, pp. 46-47, if \(\mu_f\) was continuous, we'd have that \(\lim_{n}f/n=0\) in the \(C^\infty\) topology. If \(M\) is not compact and we choose \(f\) to have noncompact support, by definition we must have that given any compact set \(K\) there is a point \(x_0\) outside the support of \(f\), i.e. such that \(f(x_0)\neq 0\).

	A contradiction follows from

	\begin{thing8}{Exercise 8.5}[\cite{muk}, Chpt. 8, Sec. 2, p. 240]\leavevmode
		Let \(X\) be a paracompact space, and \(Y\) a metrizable space. Show that a sequence \(\{f_n\}\) in \(C^\infty(X,Y)\) converges in the \(C^\infty(X,Y)\) topology iff there exists a compact set \(K \subset X\) such that \(f_n=f\) {\color{2}[outside \(K\)]} for all but finitely many \(n\), and the sequence \(\{f_n|_{K}\}\) converges uniformly to \(f|_{K}\).
	\end{thing8}

	Indeed: if \(f/n \xrightarrow{C^\infty} 0\) there would be a compact outside of which \(f/n=0\) for all but finitely many \(n\), but this is impossible since \(f\) has to be nonzero somewhere outside any compact set \(K\).

	(But I was unable to show Exercise 8.5 :(

\item 
	First notice that addition map
	\[A: C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R}) \times C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R}) \to C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R}),\qquad  (f,g)\mapsto  f+g\]
	induces a bundle map
\[\tilde{A}:J^{k}(M,\mathbb{R})\times J^{k}(M,\mathbb{R})\longrightarrow J^{k}(M,\mathbb{R})\]
which is smooth. Indeed, addition of two sections \(j^kf\) and \(j^kg\) is smooth since addition of real numbers is smooth. (To define this map formally we fix a point of \(M\) and map two \(k\)-jets at \(x\) to their sum at \(x\), which in coordinates gives a polynomial whose coefficients are sums of the coefficients of the original polynomials.)

Then we show that addition of smooth functions is \(C^\infty\)-continuous like this: Let \(U \subset C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R})\) open, then \(A^{-1}(U)\) is some set in \(C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R}) \times C^\infty (M,\mathbb{R})\). Take a point \((f,g)\) in there. Since \(f+g\) is in the open set \(U\), there is a \(k\) such that \(f+g \in M(V)\) for some \(V\) open in \(J^k(M,\mathbb{R})\). The preimage \(\tilde{A}^{-1}(V):=V_1\times V_2\) is open in \(J^k(M,\mathbb{R})\times J^{k}(M,\mathbb{R})\). Consider the \(C^\infty\)-open set \(M(V_1) \times M(V_2) \ni (f,g)\).

To conclude we must check that \(M(V_1)\times M(V_2) \subset A^{-1}(M(V))\). This means that the sum of any pair of smooth functions in \(M(V_1) \times M(V_2)\) remains in \(M(V)\). But any two smooth induce a sum of \(k\)-jets that remains in \(V\) by construction.
\iffalse
	Then an open set \(V \subset J^{k}(M,\mathbb{R})\) gives a pair of \(C^k\)-open sets \(V_1\) and \(V_2\) given as the preimage under \(\tilde{A}\). 

	\textbf{(Dani.)} Let \(U\) be a \(C^\infty\)-open set in \(C^\infty(X,Y)\) and fix \((f,g) \in +^{-1}(U)\), that is \(f+g \in U\). We must show there are neighbourhoods of \(f\) and of \(g\) such that addition of any pair of functions taken from these neighbourhoods remains in \(U\).

	%A neighbourhood of \(f\) or \(g\) in the \(C^\infty\) topology is a union of open set of different \(C^k\) topologies. To fix an open neighbourhood of $f$ is the same as fixing an open neighbourhood for some \(C^k\). These, in turn, are given by open sets of the jet bundle \(J^k(X,\mathbb{R})\).

	Since \(U\) is open in \(C^\infty\), for \(f+g \in U\) there is a \(k\) and a \(V\) open in \(C^k\) such that \(f + g \in V \subset U\). This means that the \(k\)-jets of functions in \(V\) remain are close to \(f+g\).

	Consider the translations \(V_1=V-g\) and \(V_2=V-f\). Perhaps translating is a diffeomorphism. If so, these are neighbourhoods of \(f\) and \(g\), respectively. Pick \(f' \in V_1\) and \(g' \in V_2\).

	
	\textbf{(cite{gui2}.)} This question is in fact Coro. 3.8. The following result was proved in class:

	\begin{thing6}{Proposition 3.5}[\cite{gui2}]\label{prop:3.5}\leavevmode
Let \(X,Y,Z\) be smooth manifolds. Let \(\phi:Y \to Z\) be smooth. Then the mapping \(\phi_*:C^\infty (X,Y) \to C^\infty(X,Z)\) given by \(f \mapsto \phi \circ f\) is a continuous mapping in the \(C^\infty\) topology.
	\end{thing6}
	To prove that addition is continuous it's enough to notice that \(+: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) is smooth and that in fact addition of functions in \(C^\infty(X,Y)\) is the same as the induced map or pushforward \(+_*:C^\infty(X,\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to C^\infty(X,\mathbb{R})\) mapping \((f,g) \mapsto f+g\).\fi

	Multiplication of functions is analogous; this time we should use a bundle map \(\tilde{M}\) which is also continuous since multiplication of \(k\)-jets is locally multiplication of polyonimals.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{thing1}{Problem 5}\label{prob:5}\leavevmode
Let \(X\) be a submanifold of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(k \geq  \operatorname{codim}X\). Prove that almost every subspace of dimension \(k\) intersects \(X\) transversally, i.e. the set of all subsets of dimension \(k\) that don't intersect \(X\) transversally has measure zero.
\end{thing1}

\begin{proof}[Solution]\leavevmode
For this exercise I use \cite{gui} since this problem is  exercise 7 in Chpt. 2, Sec. 3. As a preliminary remark notice that the condition \(k \geq  \operatorname{codim}X\) doesn't say much---by definition of transversality we can't have transversal intersections without this condition. Now let's start by stating
\begin{thing5}{The Transversality Theorem}[\cite{gui}, p. 68]\leavevmode
Suppose that \(F : X \times S \to Y\) is a smooth map of manifolds, where only \(X\) has boundary, and let \(Z\) be any boundaryless submanifold of \(Y\). If  both \(F\) and \(\partial  F\) are transversal to \(Z\), then for almost every \(s \in S\), both \(f_s\) and \(\partial f_s\) are transversal to \(Z\).
\end{thing5}

In order to use this result recall that in Lecture 7 of our course it was proved that

\begin{thing1}{Lemma 4.6}[\cite{gui2}, p.53]\leavevmode
Let \(X\), \(B\) and \(Z\) be smooth manifolds with \(W\) a submanifold of \(Z\). Let \(j:B \to C^\infty(X,Y)\) be a mapping (not necessarily continuous) and define \(\Phi: X \times B \to Y\) by \( \Phi(x,b)= j(b)(x)\). Assume that \(\Phi\) is smooth and that \(\Phi \pitchfork  W\). Then the set \(\{b \in B : j(b) \pitchfork  W\}\) is dense in \(B\). \textbf{And in my lecture notes I find that:} the set actually has total measure. 
\end{thing1}
I shall follow the notation from \cite{gui}.

A hint from \cite{gui} tells us to consider the map
\begin{align*}
	F: \mathbb{R}^k \times S &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \\
	\Big((t_1,\ldots,t_k), \{v_i\}_{i=1}^k \Big)&\longmapsto \sum_{i=1}^k t_iv_i
\end{align*}
where
\[S:=\{\text{set of \(k\)-frames of \(\mathbb{R}^n\)} \},\]
and show it is a submersion. (A \textit{\textbf{frame}} is a set of linearly independent vectors.) The hint suggests that \(S\) is an open set of \((\mathbb{R}^n)^k\)---we need to give \(S\) the structure of a smooth manifold! Though I'm not sure how to show it is an open set, we could consider only the \textit{orthonormal} frames, which coincide with orthonormal matrices, which may be given the structure of a smooth manifold via inverse function theorem using the map \(\mathsf{GL}(n) \to \operatorname{Mat}(n),A\mapsto A^{\mathbf{T}}A\).

Moving on, if we can show that \(F\) is transversal to \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\), we obtain that \(F_s\) is transversal to \(X\) for almost every \(k\)-frame \(s:=\{v_i\}\). The latter is exactly what we want: the map \(F_s\) is an  embedding \(\mathbb{R}^k \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\) putting \(\mathbb{R}^k\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) as the space generated by the frame \(s\). 

As suggested in the hint, to show that \(F\) is transversal to \(X\) it's enough to show it is a submersion. To this end we write the coordinate functions of \(F\) by
\[F(\vec{t},\{v_i\})=t_1 \begin{pmatrix} v_1^1\\ \vdots \\ v^n_1 \end{pmatrix} + \ldots +t_k \begin{pmatrix} v_k^1\\ \vdots \\ v^n_k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} F_1(\vec{t}, \{v_i\})\\ \vdots  \\ F_n(\vec{t},\{v_i\} \end{pmatrix} \]
where \(\vec{t}=(t_1,\ldots,t_k)\). For further clarity let's write
\begin{align*}
F_1(\vec{t},\{v_i\})&=t_1v_1^1+t_2v_2^1+\ldots+t_kv_k^1\\
F_2(\vec{t},\{v_i\})&=t_1v_1^2+t_2v_2^2+\ldots+t_kv_k^2\\
\vdots \\
F_n(\vec{t},\{v_i\})&=t_1v_1^n+t_2v_2^n+\ldots+t_kv_k^n
\end{align*}
To compute the differential of \(F\) first notice that the derivatives of the coordinate functions \(F_i\) with respect to the \(t_i\) variables gives a matrix whose columns are the coordinates of the vectors \(v_i\):
\[\left(\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial t^j}\right)_{i,j} =\begin{pmatrix} v_1^1 & v_2^1 & \ldots & v_k^1\\ v_1^2 & v_2^2 & \ldots & v_k^2\\
\vdots \\
v_1^n & v_2^n & \ldots & v_k^n\end{pmatrix} \]
which is of rank \(k\) because \(\{v_i\}\) is a frame.

The rest of the matrix \(DF_{\vec{t},\{v_i\}}\) is given by differentiating with respect to each of the coordinates of each of the basis vectors \(\{v_i\}\). So for each coordinate function we differentiate with respect to all the coordinates of the first vector, then w.r.t. the coordinates of the second vector and so on.

This gives the following matrix:
\[\left(\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial v^j}\right)_{i,j} =\begin{pmatrix}\overbrace{\begin{aligned}t_1 &\; 0 & \cdots  &\; 0\end{aligned}}^{v_1} &  \overbrace{\begin{aligned}t_2 &\; 0 & \cdots  &\; 0\end{aligned}}^{v_2} &  \cdots  &  \overbrace{\begin{aligned}t_k &\; 0 & \cdots  &\; 0\end{aligned}}^{v_k}\\
\begin{aligned}0 &\; t_1 & \cdots  &\; 0\end{aligned}& \begin{aligned}0 &\; t_2 & \cdots  &\; 0\end{aligned}& \cdots & \begin{aligned}0 &\; t_k & \cdots  &\; 0\end{aligned}\\
\begin{aligned} &\;  & \ddots  &\; \end{aligned}& \begin{aligned} &\;  & \ddots  &\; \end{aligned}& \cdots & \begin{aligned} &\;  & \ddots  &\; \end{aligned}\\
\begin{aligned}0 &\; 0 & \cdots  &\; t_1\end{aligned}& \begin{aligned}0 &\; 0 & \cdots  &\; t_2\end{aligned}& \cdots & \begin{aligned}0 &\; 0 & \cdots  &\; t_k\end{aligned}
\end{pmatrix}\]
Each of the blocks of this matrix is a multiple of the identity of \(n \times n\). In conclusion, the differential of \(F\) at \((\vec{t},\{v_i\})\) is the \(n \times (k+nk)\) matrix
\[DF_{(\vec{t},\{v_i\})}=\begin{pmatrix} \left(\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial t^j}\right)_{i,j} &\left(\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial v^j}\right)_{i,j}  \end{pmatrix} \]
And it is surjective in virtue of the second block, which is of rank \(n\) provided not all \(t_i\) are zero.
\end{proof}
